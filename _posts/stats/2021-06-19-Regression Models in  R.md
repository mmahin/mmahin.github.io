## Rigression models and correlation analysis

Regression analysis is a famous tool to find relation between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In any experiemnt dependent variables are dependent on the values of the independent variables. 

Based on the dependent and the independent variable we can derive a regression equation:

Y = β\_0 + β\_1.X

Here, Y is our dependent variable, which depends on the independent variable X.   The intercept, β\_0 is the value when independent variable X is 0. β\_1 is the slope which indicantes the average change of values in Y for change in X. The slope can give us some indication about the correlation between the two variables. For example if the slope rises with increase of values of X, there is positive correlation, if it goes downhill, there is negative correlation.
